# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

`` This is a remarkable, classic and elegant design of react project. The great thing is that I have been able to design as much as I like in this project.
 This project has tried its best to customize the components of React Bootstrap and design as we wish. I've tried customization on my own. Alhamdulillah I have been successful most of the time. Alhamdulillah again, In this project I was able to do a lot of customizations on my own which I couldn't find on YouTube and Google.
 
 Especially the hamburger button at React Bootstrap. Use of OffCanvas with Responsive Navbar, Bootstrap Carousel Indicator, Proper Use of React Router CustomLink, Use of Text with Carousel Images, etc. I'm not saying the design is the best. I know I could have done better if I had time.

However, the main elements used in this project are React, React Bootstrap, Google Font, Firebase, Mongodb, Express js, Row HTML and CSS, Json Web Token etc.``

NOTE: Images for this project are collected but optimized with my own Photoshop. Thank you so much!
